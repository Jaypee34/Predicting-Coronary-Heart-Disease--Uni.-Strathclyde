# Predicting-Coronary-Heart-Disease--Uni.-Strathclyde
This project examines potential risk factors associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) using a dataset consisting of 462 observations and 8 explanatory variables. The response variable indicates whether an individual has been diagnosed with CHD. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was undertaken to explore the size, structure, and characteristics of the data through descriptive statistics and visualisations, with the aim of identifying variables associated with CHD risk.

A logistic regression model with forward selection was developed to determine statistically significant predictors of CHD status. The model’s performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and an optimal classification threshold to assess its ability to correctly distinguish between individuals with and without CHD. In addition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to examine correlations among predictors and to assess the combined effects of variables on CHD risk.

The results of the EDA suggest that systolic blood pressure, tobacco usage, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, adiposity, body mass index, alcohol consumption, Type A behaviour pattern score, and age are important potential risk factors for CHD. PCA findings indicate that systolic blood pressure, tobacco usage, LDL cholesterol, and adiposity together explain approximately 72% of the total variance in the dataset, highlighting the strong influence of cardiovascular and lifestyle-related factors. Measures related to obesity and age also appear to contribute meaningfully to the likelihood of a CHD diagnosis.

Consistency across EDA, correlation analysis, logistic regression, and PCA supports the robustness and reliability of the findings. Overall, this study demonstrates that statistical modelling techniques can effectively identify and predict risk factors for coronary heart disease. The findings highlight the importance of data-driven approaches in supporting preventive healthcare strategies, improving risk assessment, and informing interventions aimed at managing lifestyle factors and reducing the incidence of CHD in populations.
